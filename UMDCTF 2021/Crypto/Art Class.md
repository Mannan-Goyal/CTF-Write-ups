Problem description -

> I was drawing in art class when I glanced over at my classmates drawings. I snapped a picture because I wanted to look up what it meant. Can you figure out what this drawing is?

Below this, a link was provided to download an image.

Here's the image:

Initial thoughts after looking at this image was that these were a bunch of flags from different countries and we can just decode this by looking up each country, but most of these flags did not belong to any country. So I looked up for online flag identifiers and found this [website](http://www.flag-finder.com/). Here I found out the first flag and it was a signal flag representing a specific letter. 

So I looked up for signal flags on google and dicovered that the given flags were [International maritime signal flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags). 

After this, it was just a matter of decoding each flag to the respective letter.

The flag for this challenge is **UMDCTF-{F1AG_0F_7LA9S}**.
