# Exploitation

Decode the morse code audio (I used an online decoder at [morsecode.world](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html)). You get something along the lines of `ARCANGELORICCIARDI`. Maybe it's a bit distorted sometimes, but when you search it up on google, you see that Arcangelo Ricciardi was accused of cheating in a game of chess by using morse code.

The flag is:
