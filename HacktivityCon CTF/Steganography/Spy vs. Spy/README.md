# Exploitation

The intended solution is probably to use `stegsolve`. We just opened the image in gimp, reduced brightness and increased contrast. Finally, you can see `spies}` on top of the image. We guessed the rest of the flag, using Wikipedia for information XD.

The flag is:

```
flag{two_MAD_spies}
```
